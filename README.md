# ðŸš€WhisperS2T-transcriberðŸš€
* Uses the powerful WhisperS2T and Ctranslate2 libraries to batch transcribe multiple files
* THE fastest (while still maintaining quality) Whisper model transcriber available.

## Requirements
* Python 3.11
* Nvidia GPU with CUDA 12+ software installed
  > For the initial releases I'm requiring this, but in the future I plan on support cpu-only inatallations and/or AMD gpu-acceleration as well.
* Also, you might have to customize the instructions for Linux because I don't have Linux to test.

## Installation Instructions
